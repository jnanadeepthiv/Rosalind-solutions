# you have to find how many reverse palindromes can be made of lenght from 4 to 12
# first put the sequence
# convert the seq to Seq object
# then create a for loop to start finding palindromes from range 4 to 12 in the above seq
# then start with first 4 bases to traverse along hte seq until end
# output = list the index where the palindrome started and lenght that is 4
# repeat this to 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 lenght palindrome of the sequence.
